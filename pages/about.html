      <div class="history-section">
        <h2>History & Origins</h2>
        <p>
          Crime Network began as a small online project focused on Virtual private networks, Discord bots & selfbots, stress testing tools, VPS's and an assortment of multi-tools on Mar 30, 2022.
          It was founded by a group of independent cybersecurity researchers and aspiring programmers. Crime Network had gathered a small Discord following of about 300-400 members and an active community.
          Crime Network was disbanded around August 30, 2022, after the Discord server was terminated. Crime Network made a PSA on the website at the time to all of their VPN customers that it would be shutting down in 30 days.
          After the shutdown of Crime Network, also known as Crime Network, LLC at the time remained dormant and disbanded but still under the same ownership. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As of October 11th, 2025, Crime Network is back after nearly 4 consistent years of lying dormant.<br>
          Crime Network has since undergone a complete rebranding and repositioning and is now under new management and ownership.
          Crime Network is now managed and owned by a group of independent researchers, cybersecurity, and real-world crime journalists and analysts.<br><br>
          The platform’s mission has since changed from its roots and has become a platform for real-world and cybersecurity investigations. We combine journalism, education, and privacy technology to help people understand the underworld and stay safe from it. <br>
          The only thing kept from the original roots of Crime Network is its VPN (CrimeVPN) and its discord bots.
