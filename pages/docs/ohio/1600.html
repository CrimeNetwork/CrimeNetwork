      <!-- Overview -->
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        1600EBK, also known as 600 BloccBaby Crips, emerged from the Wedgewood neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio, around 2019 to early 2020. The group formed as an offshoot of BL-800, a gang that had established a stronghold in the area. BL-800, initially known as "Bantu Life 800," was involved in various criminal activities, including theft and violent crimes. The gang's influence extended across the west side of Columbus, particularly within the Wedgewood and South Park Apartments areas

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
       1600EBK was founded between 2019 and early 2020 by DD (Damari) as an offshoot of BL-800 in the Wedgewood neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio. The group initially brought together members from multiple Crip factions, including the Rolling 60's Crips and BackSt Crips, creating a coalition to strengthen influence and territorial control in Wedgewood and surrounding areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The organization gained significant attention in late 2021–2022 after the shooting death of Damari, which became a pivotal moment in its history. His death galvanized members and reinforced a sense of unity and loyalty within the group. Since then, 1600EBK has focused on consolidating its presence in Ohio while forming strategic connections with other street organizations in the Midwest.<br><br>
        In Chicago, affiliated sets go by the names 16Gang, 1600, and Forever16, and are based in the Parkway Gardens complex (OBlock).<br><br>
        As of 2025, 1600EBK continues to maintain a presence in various neighborhoods and cities. The group's expansion into the Midwest and connections with other sets indicate a strategic approach to increasing their influence. Despite law enforcement efforts to dismantle their operations, 1600EBK remains a formidable presence in the region.<br><br>In response to the group's activities, the Columbus Division of Police initiated a crackdown on gang-related crime in the Wedgewood and South Park Apartments areas. This effort led to the arrest of 21 BL-800 gang members, with 13 already convicted

      <!-- Investigation / Details -->
      <h2>Investigation / Details</h2>
      <p>
        1600EBK has long been under scrutiny by law enforcement in Columbus, Ohio, due to its involvement in shootings, assaults, and drug trafficking. The group’s influence extends beyond Wedgewood, with ties to affiliated sets in other cities, and its ongoing territorial disputes with rival gangs have kept police attention focused on their activities.
