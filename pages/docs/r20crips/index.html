        The Rolling 20’s Crips, also known as the West Adams Crips, are one of the oldest and most recognized Crip sets based in Los Angeles, California. 
        Established in the 1970s, they have deep roots in the Crip movement and are known for their long-standing presence within South Central’s gang landscape.
